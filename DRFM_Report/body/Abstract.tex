Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) is a technique used to record an incoming Radio Frequency (RF) signal, in turn applying a series of time-delays, amplitude scalings and frequency shifts and retransmitting the signal. This technique is used widely in the electronic defense industry as a form of radar jamming, in that it allows for the synthesis of artificial targets. This paper discusses the design of implementation of a DRFM system on a low cost FPGA system and documents this system's performance.
